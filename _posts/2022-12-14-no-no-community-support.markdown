After years of working within particular FOSS project/community I've come to a conclusion that it does not do good for me personal mood. So for now, I've disabled my slack and discourse accounts, removed all bullshit git repositories, archived the ones that might be helpful to some and transfered the rest to be community maintained git organisation.

So long and thanks for all the fish!
